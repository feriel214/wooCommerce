# WordPress WooCommerce Website
This is a WordPress WooCommerce website that I created as part of my auto-learning journey. I imported a pre-designed theme and configured the required plugins to build an e-commerce website that showcases products and allows customers to purchase them online.

# Technologies Used
- WordPress
- WooCommerce
- Pre-designed Theme
- Contact Form 7
- WPForms
# Features
- **Custom Theme**: I imported a pre-designed theme and customized it to fit the branding and requirements of the project.
- **WooCommerce Integration**: I integrated the WooCommerce plugin to create an e-commerce website that allows customers to purchase products online.
- **Cart Page**: The cart page displays the items added to the cart and allows customers to adjust quantities, remove items or continue shopping.
- **Checkout Page**: The checkout page displays the order summary and allows customers to fill out their billing and shipping information, choose a payment method and submit the order.
- **Homepage**: The homepage features a slider showcasing the products or promotions, a featured products section and a section with the latest blog posts to keep customers engaged and informed.
- **Contact Forms**: I used Contact Form 7 and WPForms plugins to create custom contact forms that allow customers to reach out with inquiries or feedback.
- **Responsive Design**: The website is designed to be fully responsive and optimized for all devices including desktop, tablet and mobile.
